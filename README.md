# Formatted names
### Placeholder API in anvils

</div>

### Credit
This mod (even this README) is HEAVILY taking code from the [ColorfulAnvils](https://github.com/27rogi/ColorfulAnvils) mod and it's [fork](https://github.com/JustAlittleWolf/ColorfulAnvils/tree/1.20.x) by @JustAlittleWolf, so big thanks to them.

### Usage
This mod uses [PlaceholderAPI](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/text-format/) by @Patbox which allows you to format text with support for **RGB** colors, **gradients**, and many more! Simply rename item using tags.

### Known problems
**No problems are known at this moment**, but be aware because this mod uses mixins to modify original Minecraft anvil code and this may cause issues with mods that do the same thing!
